> [Youtube Engagement](https://engagement-predictor.streamlit.app/) is an analytics tool designed to help content creators understand their audience. The app is a Streamlit dashboard that predicts a video's view quantile rank using sklearn regression models over OpenAI description embeddings, identifies relevant content themes, provides AI title rewrites, and displays visualizations to help creators.

The app was built thanks to the following tools: Streamlit, OpenAI API, Scikit-learn, Chroma, YouTube Data API, and Altair.
